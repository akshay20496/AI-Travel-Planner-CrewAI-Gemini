Create Conda Environment : conda create -p venv python==3.10  (I did this anaconda prompt)

- Select Your Conda Environment in VS Code

  1.In VS Code, press Ctrl + Shift + P (or Cmd + Shift + P on Mac).

  2.Type "Python: Select Interpreter" and hit Enter.

  3.Look for your Conda environment name in the list (it will look like conda env:your_env_name or show the path to the env folder).

  4.Click it.

- Activate It in the VS Code Terminal

  Once you’ve selected the interpreter:

   1.Open a terminal in VS Code (Ctrl + ~)

   2.It should already be using your Conda env (you’ll see (your_env_name) before the prompt).

   3.If not, type: conda activate path_to_your_env

- Install Your Packages

   Inside that activated terminal: pip install -r requirements.txt

For streamlit : python -m streamlit run app.py
